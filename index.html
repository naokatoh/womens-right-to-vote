<h2>Three Facts on women's suffrage in the world</h2>

<h3><span>1</span>New Zealand was the first nation in the world to give all women the right to vote at the national level </h3>

<p class="content">
    Universal suffrage was first realized in the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century. However, <a href="https://revolution.chnm.org/exhibits/show/liberty--equality--fraternity/women-and-the-revolution#:~:text=Women%20never%20gained%20full%20political,neither%20vote%20nor%20hold%20office)." target="new">only men were granted the right to vote</a>. Even during the Revolution, it was believed that men should participate in society and women should support men.
</p>
<p class="content">
    In the 19th century, movements for women's suffrage became active, especially in the U.S. and Europe. However, it was <b>New Zealand</b>, then a British colony, that became the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote at the national level. The movement was led by British-born suffragist <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage" target="new">Kate Sheppard</a>.
</p>



<h3><span>2</span>Not All Women Were "Women"? Some countries divided women by ethnicity, property or marital status</h3>

<p class="content">
    In <b>Australia</b>, non-indigenous women were granted the vote in the national level as early as 1902. But indigenous people were not given the right until 1962. Similarly in <b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309131216/http://www.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/aboriginals/aboriginals12_e.html" target="new">Canada</a></b>, aboriginal people (not only women but also men) were not given the right to vote until 1960. 
</p>


<p class="content">
Some countries, such as <b>Bulgaria</b>, permitted married women to vote in 1937, but unmarried women were not allowed to vote until 1944. In many countries, women without property qualifications were initially not allowed to vote.
</p>
<h3><span>3</span>Voting rights were granted. Some countries, however, allow their citizens to exercise them only at local elections</h3>

<p class="content">
  In <a href="https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Womens-Political-Participation-in-Myanmar-MP-Experiences_report-1.pdf" target ="new"><b>Myanmar</b></a>, women were allowed vote as early as 1935 but in practice, most of the women in the country could not actively participate in the politics due to the decades-long military rule. In <b>Brunei</b>, women can also vote, but with national elections suspended, they cannot exercise their right except for local elections.  
</p>

<p class="content">
 Similarly, <b>Saudi Arabia</b>, which <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35075702" target="new">allowed women to registered to vote in 2015</a>, has no national elections so far. In <a href ="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/womens-rights-afghanistan-history" target="new"><b>Afghanistan</b></a>, women's political participation was restricted during the Taliban regime from the late 1990s to 2001. In Afghanistan, women have been able to vote again since the US-led international intervention in 2021, but discrimination against women is escalating after the Taliban seized power again in 2021.
